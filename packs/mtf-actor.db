Although they mostly learn their secrets from the dead, they aren't above spying on the living to take knowledge from them as well. A berbalang can create a spectral duplicate of itself and send the duplicate out to gather information on other planes by watching places where the gods and their servants gather. When a berbalang is perceiving its environment through its duplicate, its actual body is @condition[unconscious] and can't protect or nourish itself. Thus, a berbalang typically uses its duplicate for only a short time before returning its consciousness to its body.</p><div class=\"rd__spc-inline-post\"></div></div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--3\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--3\" data-title-index=\"3339\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner help-subtle\">Weird Oracles.</span></span> <p>The knowledge that berbalangs accumulate makes them great sources of information for powerful people traveling the planes. Berbalangs ignore petitioners, however, unless they come bearing a choice secret or the bones of a particularly interesting creature.

So intense is his paranoia that he almost never travels farther than the sprawling city that lies outside his magnificent palace. Dispater knows he has enemies on all sides‚Äîenemies who would do to him what has been done to the likes of Geryon, Moloch, and so many others.</p><div class=\"rd__spc-inline-post\"></div><p>Dispater is correct to fear, but the true threat comes not from without. The lord's great error was allowing himself to be seduced by Titivilus, who beguiled his way into being the primary advisor in Dispater's household.</p><p>Although he is inferior in physical strength and power when compared to other archdevils, Titivilus compensates with cunning. A shrewd and calculating politician, he has clawed his way up through the ranks to become the second-most powerful fiend in Dis, entirely by saying just the right thing at the right time to get what he wanted. Charming and pleasant, he is a master at negotiation, able to twist words in such a way as to leave his victims confused and believing they have found a friend in Titivilus. Through these skills, Titivilus has manipulated everyone along his path to power, either to win them over to his cause or to remove them as a threat.</p><p>Since gaining his position, Titivilus has convinced Dispater that countless plots are being hatched against him and that Asmodeus himself seeks to remove Dispater from power. In response, Dispater has withdrawn to his palace and left day-to-day decisions to Titivilus, while also authorizing him to answer and negotiate bargains with mortals who attempt to summon Dispater. Titivilus now represents his master and speaks with his voice, a turn of events that leads some to whisper that either Titivilus is Dispater in disguise, or that Titivilus has removed the archduke and replaced him altogether.</p><p>Titivilus recognizes the inherent precariousness of his position. After all, Dispater's acceptance of his plans and his advice can last only so long before some other plotter steps in and reveals the truth. For insurance, Titivilus has begun recruiting outsiders to deal with problem devils, to insulate himself against criticism, and, above all, to create complications that he can solve so as to reinforce his value in the eyes of his master. Titivilus finds adventurers well suited to the tasks he needs performed and recruits them directly or through intermediaries, expending them later as his plans require.</p></div></div></div>","public":""},"alignment":"lawful evil","race":"","type":{"value":"fiend","subtype":"devil","swarm":null,"custom":""},"environment":"","cr":16,"spellLevel":0,"xp":{"value":15000},"source":"MTF","class":{}},"traits":{"size":"med","di":{"value":["fire","poison"],"custom":""},"dr":{"value":["cold","physical"],"custom":""},"dv":{"value":[],"custom":""},"ci":{"value":["charmed","exhaustion","frightened","poisoned"],"custom":""},"languages":{"value":["common","aarakocra","abyssal","aquan","auran","celestial","deep","draconic","druidic","dwarvish","elvish","giant","gith","gnomish","goblin","gnoll","halfling","ignan","infernal","orc","primordial","sylvan","terran","cant","undercommon","custom"],"custom":"telepathy 120 ft."}},"currency":{"pp":0,"gp":0,"ep":0,"sp":0,"cp":0},"skills":{"acr":{"value":0,"ability":"dex","mod":6,"bonus":0,"passive":16},"ani":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","mod":6,"bonus":0,"passive":16},"arc":{"value":0,"ability":"int","mod":7,"bonus":0,"passive":17},"ath":{"value":0,"ability":"str","mod":4,"bonus":0,"passive":14},"dec":{"value":1,"ability":"cha","mod":8,"bonus":0,"passive":18},"his":{"value":0,"ability":"int","mod":7,"bonus":0,"passive":17},"ins":{"value":1,"ability":"wis","mod":6,"bonus":0,"passive":16},"itm":{"value":1,"ability":"cha","mod":8,"bonus":0,"passive":18},"inv":{"value":0,"ability":"int","mod":7,"bonus":0,"passive":17},"med":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","mod":6,"bonus":0,"passive":16},"nat":{"value":0,"ability":"int","mod":7,"bonus":0,"passive":17},"prc":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","mod":6,"bonus":0,"passive":16},"prf":{"value":0,"ability":"cha","mod":8,"bonus":0,"passive":18},"per":{"value":1,"ability":"cha","mod":8,"bonus":0,"passive":18},"rel":{"value":0,"ability":"int","mod":7,"bonus":0,"passive":17},"slt":{"value":0,"ability":"dex","mod":6,"bonus":0,"passive":16},"ste":{"value":0,"ability":"dex","mod":6,"bonus":0,"passive":16},"sur":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","mod":6,"bonus":0,"passive":16}},"spells":{"spell1":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell2":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell3":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell4":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell5":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell6":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell7":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell8":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell9":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"pact":{"value":0,"override":null},"spell0":{"value":0,"max":0}},"bonuses":{"mwak":{"attack":"","damage":""},"rwak":{"attack":"","damage":""},"msak":{"attack":"","damage":""},"rsak":{"attack":"","damage":""},"abilities":{"check":"","save":"","skill":""},"spell":{"dc":""}},"resources":{"legact":{"value":3,"max":3},"legres":{"value":3,"max":3},"lair":{"value":false,"initiative":20}}},"token":{"displayName":20,"vision":true,"disposition":-1,"displayBars":40,"bar1":{"attribute":"attributes.hp"},"bar2":{"attribute":null},"dimSight":120,"brightSight":0,"name":"Titivilus","img":"https://assets.forge-vtt.com/60f6df8c8ea0d66d4f271bc4/assets/srd5e/img/MTF/Titivilus.png","width":1,"height":1,"scale":1,"elevation":0,"rotation":0,"actorLink":false,"actorData":{},"flags":{},"effects":[],"randomImg":false,"mirrorX":false,"mirrorY":false,"lockRotation":false,"alpha":1,"dimLight":0,"brightLight":0,"sightAngle":0,"lightAngle":0,"lightAlpha":0.25,"lightAnimation":{"speed":5,"intensity":5}},"items":[{"name":"Feeblemind","type":"spell","data":{"description":{"value":"<div  class=\"rd__b  rd__b--3\"><p>You blast the mind of a creature that you can see within range, attempting to shatter its intellect and personality.

When the dreadnought dies, its demiplane vanishes, and its contents are released into the Astral Plane.</p><p>An astral dreadnought doesn't communicate.

Standing nearly nine feet tall, Graz'zt strikes the perfect figure of untamed desire, every plane and curve of his body, every glance of his burning eyes, promising a mixture of pleasure and pain. A subtle wrongness pervades his beauty, from the cruel cast of his features to the six fingers on each hand and six toes on each foot.

They frequently wear alabaster masks with ecstatic expressions and ostentatious dress and body ornamentation to their secret assignations.</p><p>Although he prefers charm and subtle manipulation, Graz'zt is capable of terrible violence when provoked.

Graz'zt's lair is a den of ostentation and hedonism. It is adorned with finery and decorations so decadent that even the wealthiest of mortals would blush at the excess.

Duke Bael, one of Mammon's most important vassals, has won fame and acclaim for his victories. Charged with leading sixty-six companies of @creature[barbed devil||barbed devils], Bael has proven to be a tactical genius, earning esteem for himself and his master as a result of victory after victory over the abyssal host. Mammon relies on Bael, because of his battle acumen, to safeguard his holdings. Mammon has never been ousted during a time when so many other archdevils have lost their positions, which is a testament to Bael's skill on the battlefield.</p><div class=\"rd__spc-inline-post\"></div><p>For his accomplishments, as well as for the hue of his skin, Baal has been granted the title of Bronze General. His accolades notwithstanding, Bael has had a difficult time navigating the quagmire of infernal politics. His critics call him naive, though never to his face. His primary interest has always been leading soldiers in battle, so he finds it frustrating to have his ambitions of ascending to a higher rank constantly stymied by politically shrewd rivals.</p><p>Bael prefers to make servants out of his adversaries, and mortals bound to his service earn their wretched place by falling victim to Bael's superior stratagems. Bael gladly spares the lives of those he defeats, but only if they pledge their souls and service to him. Although he is willing to corrupt almost any being in this way, he always destroys any demons he defeats.</p><p>Bael also welcomes mortals into his service if they can provide him with an advantage in his own politicking. He recruits savvy individuals and relies on them to represent his interests at Mammon's court, which leaves Bael free to pursue his battle lust.</p><p>Despite his lack of interest in affairs outside battle, or perhaps because of it, Bael has gained a small following of cultists. Those who worship at his altar call him the King of Hell, and the most deluded believe that he is the lord of all devils. In arcane circles, certain writings, such as the dreaded Book of Fire, say that Bael revealed the @spell[invisibility] spell to the world, though some scholars of magic hotly refute such claims. Bael is sometimes depicted as a toad, a cat, a male human, or some combination of these forms, though none of these images reflect his true appearance.</p></div></div></div>","public":""},"alignment":"lawful evil","race":"","type":{"value":"fiend","subtype":"devil","swarm":null,"custom":""},"environment":"","cr":19,"spellLevel":0,"xp":{"value":22000},"source":"MTF","class":{}},"traits":{"size":"lg","di":{"value":["fire","poison"],"custom":""},"dr":{"value":["cold","physical"],"custom":""},"dv":{"value":[],"custom":""},"ci":{"value":["charmed","exhaustion","frightened","poisoned"],"custom":""},"languages":{"value":["common","aarakocra","abyssal","aquan","auran","celestial","deep","draconic","druidic","dwarvish","elvish","giant","gith","gnomish","goblin","gnoll","halfling","ignan","infernal","orc","primordial","sylvan","terran","cant","undercommon","custom"],"custom":"telepathy 120 ft."}},"currency":{"pp":0,"gp":0,"ep":0,"sp":0,"cp":0},"skills":{"acr":{"value":0,"ability":"dex","mod":3,"bonus":0,"passive":13},"ani":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","mod":7,"bonus":0,"passive":17},"arc":{"value":0,"ability":"int","mod":5,"bonus":0,"passive":15},"ath":{"value":0,"ability":"str","mod":7,"bonus":0,"passive":17},"dec":{"value":0,"ability":"cha","mod":7,"bonus":0,"passive":17},"his":{"value":0,"ability":"int","mod":5,"bonus":0,"passive":15},"ins":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","mod":7,"bonus":0,"passive":17},"itm":{"value":1,"ability":"cha","mod":7,"bonus":0,"passive":17},"inv":{"value":0,"ability":"int","mod":5,"bonus":0,"passive":15},"med":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","mod":7,"bonus":0,"passive":17},"nat":{"value":0,"ability":"int","mod":5,"bonus":0,"passive":15},"prc":{"value":1,"ability":"wis","mod":7,"bonus":0,"passive":17},"prf":{"value":0,"ability":"cha","mod":7,"bonus":0,"passive":17},"per":{"value":1,"ability":"cha","mod":7,"bonus":0,"passive":17},"rel":{"value":0,"ability":"int","mod":5,"bonus":0,"passive":15},"slt":{"value":0,"ability":"dex","mod":3,"bonus":0,"passive":13},"ste":{"value":0,"ability":"dex","mod":3,"bonus":0,"passive":13},"sur":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","mod":7,"bonus":0,"passive":17}},"spells":{"spell1":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell2":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell3":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell4":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell5":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell6":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell7":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell8":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell9":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"pact":{"value":0,"override":null},"spell0":{"value":0,"max":0}},"bonuses":{"mwak":{"attack":"","damage":""},"rwak":{"attack":"","damage":""},"msak":{"attack":"","damage":""},"rsak":{"attack":"","damage":""},"abilities":{"check":"","save":"","skill":""},"spell":{"dc":""}},"resources":{"legact":{"value":3,"max":3},"legres":{"value":3,"max":3},"lair":{"value":false,"initiative":20}}},"token":{"displayName":20,"vision":true,"disposition":-1,"displayBars":40,"bar1":{"attribute":"attributes.hp"},"bar2":{"attribute":null},"dimSight":0,"brightSight":120,"name":"Bael","img":"https://assets.forge-vtt.com/60f6df8c8ea0d66d4f271bc4/assets/srd5e/img/MTF/Bael.png","width":2,"height":2,"scale":1,"elevation":0,"rotation":0,"actorLink":false,"actorData":{},"flags":{},"effects":[],"randomImg":false,"mirrorX":false,"mirrorY":false,"lockRotation":false,"alpha":1,"dimLight":0,"brightLight":0,"sightAngle":0,"lightAngle":0,"lightAlpha":0.25,"lightAnimation":{"speed":5,"intensity":5}},"items":[{"name":"Dominate Monster","type":"spell","data":{"description":{"value":"<div  class=\"rd__b  rd__b--3\"><p>You attempt to beguile a creature that you can see within range.

Long ago, Moloch earned his place among the other archdevils through the glory he won driving demons out of the Nine Hells. Asmodeus rewarded him by elevating Moloch to the rulership of Malbolge.</p><div class=\"rd__spc-inline-post\"></div><p>For eons, Moloch ruled his domain, vying against the other archdevils as he sought still greater power. This animosity worked in Asmodeus's favor, since Asmodeus knew that Moloch's scheming helped keep the other archdevils in check. The arrangement began to unravel, however, when Moloch took the night hag named Malagard for his advisor. Her words were poison, and gradually she convinced Moloch to direct his efforts to topple Asmodeus.</p><p>Although the conspiracy nearly succeeded, it was thwarted. Moloch was stripped of his station and sentenced to death‚Äîand only the timely use of a planar portal allowed him to escape.</p><p>Moloch wasted no time in preparing for his return. He amassed an army of devils and monsters and left them to make final preparations for invading the Nine Hells, while he ventured to a distant Material Plane in the hope of finding an artifact that would ensure his success. While there, he became trapped, leaving his armies at the mercy of his enemies. In short order they were destroyed.</p><p>Now, Moloch has been rendered nearly powerless after his last failure. He endlessly schemes of ways to return to his former status, but every time he enters the Nine Hells, he is demoted to an imp and can't regain his normal powers until he leaves. Thus, he lives a split existence, sometimes scheming in Malbolge or other layers of the Hells and at other times wandering the planes searching for magical might or secrets that might help him win back his title.</p><p>Rumors suggest that he can often be found in Sigil, where he bargains with yugoloths to build yet another army with which he might invade Malbolge and wrest the throne from Glasya. Bereft as he is, he has little to offer in exchange, so he might bargain with mortals to gain their aid in acquiring coin, jewels, and other riches in return for knowledge about the Nine Hells and the other planes.</p><p>Most of Moloch's cultists have switched allegiance to one of the other archdevils, but idols constructed to honor him still stand in deep dungeons, their jeweled eyes and the remnants of power they hold drawing monstrous worshipers and unwise adventurers into places where his foul influence remains.</p></div></div></div>","public":""},"alignment":"lawful evil","race":"","type":{"value":"fiend","subtype":"devil","swarm":null,"custom":""},"environment":"","cr":21,"spellLevel":0,"xp":{"value":33000},"source":"MTF","class":{}},"traits":{"size":"lg","di":{"value":["fire","poison"],"custom":""},"dr":{"value":["cold","physical"],"custom":""},"dv":{"value":[],"custom":""},"ci":{"value":["charmed","exhaustion","frightened","poisoned"],"custom":""},"languages":{"value":["common","aarakocra","abyssal","aquan","auran","celestial","deep","draconic","druidic","dwarvish","elvish","giant","gith","gnomish","goblin","gnoll","halfling","ignan","infernal","orc","primordial","sylvan","terran","cant","undercommon","custom"],"custom":"telepathy 120 ft."}},"currency":{"pp":0,"gp":0,"ep":0,"sp":0,"cp":0},"skills":{"acr":{"value":0,"ability":"dex","mod":4,"bonus":0,"passive":14},"ani":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","mod":4,"bonus":0,"passive":14},"arc":{"value":0,"ability":"int","mod":5,"bonus":0,"passive":15},"ath":{"value":0,"ability":"str","mod":8,"bonus":0,"passive":18},"dec":{"value":1,"ability":"cha","mod":6,"bonus":0,"passive":16},"his":{"value":0,"ability":"int","mod":5,"bonus":0,"passive":15},"ins":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","mod":4,"bonus":0,"passive":14},"itm":{"value":1,"ability":"cha","mod":6,"bonus":0,"passive":16},"inv":{"value":0,"ability":"int","mod":5,"bonus":0,"passive":15},"med":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","mod":4,"bonus":0,"passive":14},"nat":{"value":0,"ability":"int","mod":5,"bonus":0,"passive":15},"prc":{"value":1,"ability":"wis","mod":4,"bonus":0,"passive":14},"prf":{"value":0,"ability":"cha","mod":6,"bonus":0,"passive":16},"per":{"value":0,"ability":"cha","mod":6,"bonus":0,"passive":16},"rel":{"value":0,"ability":"int","mod":5,"bonus":0,"passive":15},"slt":{"value":0,"ability":"dex","mod":4,"bonus":0,"passive":14},"ste":{"value":0,"ability":"dex","mod":4,"bonus":0,"passive":14},"sur":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","mod":4,"bonus":0,"passive":14}},"spells":{"spell1":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell2":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell3":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell4":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell5":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell6":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell7":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell8":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell9":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"pact":{"value":0,"override":null},"spell0":{"value":0,"max":0}},"bonuses":{"mwak":{"attack":"","damage":""},"rwak":{"attack":"","damage":""},"msak":{"attack":"","damage":""},"rsak":{"attack":"","damage":""},"abilities":{"check":"","save":"","skill":""},"spell":{"dc":""}},"resources":{"legact":{"value":3,"max":3},"legres":{"value":3,"max":3},"lair":{"value":false,"initiative":20}}},"token":{"displayName":20,"vision":true,"disposition":-1,"displayBars":40,"bar1":{"attribute":"attributes.hp"},"bar2":{"attribute":null},"dimSight":120,"brightSight":0,"name":"Moloch","img":"https://assets.forge-vtt.com/60f6df8c8ea0d66d4f271bc4/assets/srd5e/img/MTF/Moloch.png","width":2,"height":2,"scale":1,"elevation":0,"rotation":0,"actorLink":false,"actorData":{},"flags":{},"effects":[],"randomImg":false,"mirrorX":false,"mirrorY":false,"lockRotation":false,"alpha":1,"dimLight":0,"brightLight":0,"sightAngle":0,"lightAngle":0,"lightAlpha":0.25,"lightAnimation":{"speed":5,"intensity":5}},"items":[{"name":"Flame Strike","type":"spell","data":{"description":{"value":"<div  class=\"rd__b  rd__b--3\"><p>A vertical column of divine fire roars down from the heavens in a location you specify.

Alliances form all the time, but most wind up unraveling due to treachery. Nevertheless, for all their backbiting and betrayal, the devils do occasionally display loyalty, offering unwavering service to their masters. One such example is Hutijin, a duke of Cania and loyal servant of Mephistopheles.</p><div class=\"rd__spc-inline-post\"></div><p>Across the Hells, Hutijin's name fills lesser devils with fear and loathing, for this duke commands two companies of pit fiends, which make up Cania's aristocracy. With such soldiers under his command, Hutijin can easily crush any rival who gets in his way, while also providing Mephistopheles with security against armies that might seek to contest his dominion. Hutijin has amassed enough power to challenge the lord of Cania, but he has never wavered in his support for his master‚Äîsuggesting, perhaps, that Mephistopheles has some hold over him.</p><p>Outside the Nine Hells, Hutijin is a relatively obscure figure, known only to the most learned infernal scholars. He has no cults of his own, and his servants are few in number. The reason is simple: Hutijin hates mortals. When summoned from the Hells, he repays the instigator with a long and agonizing death.</p><p>Mephistopheles forbids Hutijin from making too many forays into the Material Plane, since the duke's absence leaves him vulnerable to his rivals. Other archdevils know how much Hutijin despises mortals and have secretly disseminated the means to call him from the Nine Hells in the hope of distracting the archdevil long enough for them to assail Mephistopheles. Hutijin sends devils into the Material Plane to eradicate mention of his name and destroy those who have learned of him, but the summonings still occur. When called from his post, he negotiates as quickly as he can, usually closing a deal with little cost to the summoner. However, once the deal has been struck, Hutijin repays the interruption with death.</p></div></div></div>","public":""},"alignment":"lawful evil","race":"","type":{"value":"fiend","subtype":"devil","swarm":null,"custom":""},"environment":"","cr":21,"spellLevel":0,"xp":{"value":33000},"source":"MTF","class":{}},"traits":{"size":"lg","di":{"value":["fire","poison"],"custom":""},"dr":{"value":["cold","physical"],"custom":""},"dv":{"value":[],"custom":""},"ci":{"value":["charmed","exhaustion","frightened","poisoned"],"custom":""},"languages":{"value":["common","aarakocra","abyssal","aquan","auran","celestial","deep","draconic","druidic","dwarvish","elvish","giant","gith","gnomish","goblin","gnoll","halfling","ignan","infernal","orc","primordial","sylvan","terran","cant","undercommon","custom"],"custom":"telepathy 120 ft."}},"currency":{"pp":0,"gp":0,"ep":0,"sp":0,"cp":0},"skills":{"acr":{"value":0,"ability":"dex","mod":2,"bonus":0,"passive":12},"ani":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","mod":4,"bonus":0,"passive":14},"arc":{"value":0,"ability":"int","mod":6,"bonus":0,"passive":16},"ath":{"value":0,"ability":"str","mod":8,"bonus":0,"passive":18},"dec":{"value":0,"ability":"cha","mod":7,"bonus":0,"passive":17},"his":{"value":0,"ability":"int","mod":6,"bonus":0,"passive":16},"ins":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","mod":4,"bonus":0,"passive":14},"itm":{"value":1,"ability":"cha","mod":7,"bonus":0,"passive":17},"inv":{"value":0,"ability":"int","mod":6,"bonus":0,"passive":16},"med":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","mod":4,"bonus":0,"passive":14},"nat":{"value":0,"ability":"int","mod":6,"bonus":0,"passive":16},"prc":{"value":1,"ability":"wis","mod":4,"bonus":0,"passive":14},"prf":{"value":0,"ability":"cha","mod":7,"bonus":0,"passive":17},"per":{"value":0,"ability":"cha","mod":7,"bonus":0,"passive":17},"rel":{"value":0,"ability":"int","mod":6,"bonus":0,"passive":16},"slt":{"value":0,"ability":"dex","mod":2,"bonus":0,"passive":12},"ste":{"value":0,"ability":"dex","mod":2,"bonus":0,"passive":12},"sur":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","mod":4,"bonus":0,"passive":14}},"spells":{"spell1":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell2":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell3":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell4":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell5":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell6":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell7":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell8":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell9":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"pact":{"value":0,"override":null},"spell0":{"value":0,"max":0}},"bonuses":{"mwak":{"attack":"","damage":""},"rwak":{"attack":"","damage":""},"msak":{"attack":"","damage":""},"rsak":{"attack":"","damage":""},"abilities":{"check":"","save":"","skill":""},"spell":{"dc":""}},"resources":{"legact":{"value":3,"max":3},"legres":{"value":3,"max":3},"lair":{"value":false,"initiative":20}}},"token":{"displayName":20,"vision":true,"disposition":-1,"displayBars":40,"bar1":{"attribute":"attributes.hp"},"bar2":{"attribute":null},"dimSight":0,"brightSight":120,"name":"Hutijin","img":"https://assets.forge-vtt.com/60f6df8c8ea0d66d4f271bc4/assets/srd5e/img/MTF/Hutijin.png","width":2,"height":2,"scale":1,"elevation":0,"rotation":0,"actorLink":false,"actorData":{},"flags":{},"effects":[],"randomImg":false,"mirrorX":false,"mirrorY":false,"lockRotation":false,"alpha":1,"dimLight":0,"brightLight":0,"sightAngle":0,"lightAngle":0,"lightAlpha":0.25,"lightAnimation":{"speed":5,"intensity":5}},"items":[{"name":"Heal","type":"spell","data":{"description":{"value":"<div  class=\"rd__b  rd__b--3\"><p>Choose a creature that you can see within range.

Any effect that removes a disease allows a creature's hit point maximum to return to normal before that time passes.</p><div class=\"rd__spc-inline-post\"></div></div>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"source":"PHB","activation":{"type":"action","cost":1,"condition":""},"duration":{"value":0,"units":"inst"},"target":{"value":1,"width":null,"units":"","type":"creature"},"range":{"value":60,"long":null,"units":"ft"},"uses":{"value":0,"max":0,"per":""},"consume":{"type":"","target":null,"amount":null},"ability":"wis","actionType":"save","attackBonus":0,"chatFlavor":"","critical":null,"damage":{"parts":[["14d6","necrotic"]],"versatile":""},"formula":"","save":{"ability":"con","dc":null,"scaling":"wis"},"level":6,"school":"nec","components":{"value":"","vocal":true,"somatic":true,"material":false,"ritual":false,"concentration":false},"materials":{"value":"","consumed":false,"cost":0,"supply":0},"preparation":{"mode":"prepared","prepared":true},"scaling":{"mode":"none","formula":""}},"img":"modules/plutonium/media/icon/spell/phb-harm.webp","flags":{"srd5e":{"page":"spells.html","source":"PHB","hash":"harm_phb","propDroppable":"spell"}},"effects":[],"_id":"4tldfwnr0m72vcg0","folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0}},{"name":"True Seeing","type":"spell","data":{"description":{"value":"<div  class=\"rd__b  rd__b--3\"><p>This spell gives the willing creature you touch the ability to see things as they actually are.
