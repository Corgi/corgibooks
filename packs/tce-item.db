Crafted of a gleaming black alloy of unknown origin, the servant is often described as a combination of a disproportioned dwarf and an oversized beetle. The servant contains enough space for 1 ton of cargo and a crew compartment within, from which up to two Medium creatures can control it-and potentially execute a spree of unstoppable destruction.</p><p>Tales of the servant's origins involve more conjecture than fact, often referring to otherworldly beings, the mysterious Barrier Peaks in Oerth, and the supposedly related device known as the <i>Machine of Lum the Mad</i>. The best details on the device's origins and operation can be found in the <i>Mind of Metal</i>, a tome of artificer's secrets that connects the device to the traditions of the lost Olman people, and which was written by Lum the Mad's several times over granddaughter, Lum the Maestro, while she reconstructed the long disassembled <i>Mighty Servant of Leuk-o</i>.</p><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--3\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--3\" data-title-index=\"5208\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner help-subtle\">Dangerous Attunement.</span></span> <p>Two creatures can be attuned to the servant at a time.

While crew members are attuning themselves, any creature or structure outside and within 50 feet of the servant has a [[/r 1d100]] (25 percent) chance of being accidentally targeted by one of its Destructive Fist attacks once during the attunement. This process must be undergone every time a creature attunes itself to the artifact.</p></div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--3\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--3\" data-title-index=\"5209\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner help-subtle\">Controlling the Servant.</span></span> <p>While any creatures are attuned to the artifact, attuned creatures can open the hatch as easily as any other door. Other creatures can open the hatch as an action with a successful DC 25 Dexterity check using @item[thieves' tools|PHB]. A @spell[knock] spell cast on the hatch also opens it until the start of the caster's next turn.</p><div class=\"rd__spc-inline-post\"></div><p>A creature can enter or exit through the hatch by spending 10 feet of movement. Those inside the servant have total cover from effects originating outside it. The controls within it allow creatures to see outside without obstruction.</p><p>While you are inside the servant, you can command it by using the controls. During your turn (for either attuned creature), you can command it in the following ways:</p><ul class=\"rd__list\"><li class=\"rd__li \">Open or close the hatch (no action required, once per turn)</li><li class=\"rd__li \">Move the servant up to its speed (no action required)</li><li class=\"rd__li \">As an action, you can command the servant to take one of the actions in its stat block or some other action.</li><li class=\"rd__li \">When a creature provokes an opportunity attack from the servant, you can use your reaction to command the servant to make one Destructive Fist attack against that creature.</li></ul><p>While there are no attuned creatures inside the servant, it is an inert object.</p></div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--3\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--3\" data-title-index=\"5210\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner help-subtle\">Ghost in the Machine.</span></span> <p>Upon his death, the soul of the mighty warlord Leuk-o was drawn into the artifact and has become its animating force. The servant has been known to attack or move of its own accord, particularly if doing so will cause destruction. Once every 24 hours, the servant, at the DM's discretion, takes one action while uncrewed.</p><div class=\"rd__spc-inline-post\"></div><p>If the servant loses half of its hit points or more, each creature attuned to it must succeed on a DC 20 Wisdom saving throw or be @condition[charmed] for 24 hours. While @condition[charmed] in this way, the creature goes on a destructive spree, seeking to destroy structures and attack any unattuned creatures within sight of the servant, starting with those threatening the artifact-preferably using the servant, if possible.</p></div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--3\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--3\" data-title-index=\"5211\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner help-subtle\">Self-Destruct.</span></span> <p>By inputting a specific series of lever pulls and button presses, the servant's two crew members can cause it to explode. The self-destruct code is not revealed to crew members when they attune to the artifact. If the code is discovered (the DM determines how), it requires two attuned crew members to be inside the servant and spend their actions on 3 consecutive rounds performing the command. Should the crew members begin the process of entering the code, though, the servant uses its Ghost in the Machine property and turns the crew members against each other.</p><div class=\"rd__spc-inline-post\"></div><p>If the crew members successfully implement the code, at the end of the third round, the servant explodes. Every creature in a 100-foot-radius sphere centered on the servant must make a DC 25 Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 87 ([[/r 25d6]]) force damage, 87 ([[/r 25d6]]) lightning damage, and 87 ([[/r 25d6]]) thunder damage. On a successful save, a creature takes half as much damage. Objects and structures in the area take triple damage. Creatures inside the servant are slain instantly and leave behind no remains.</p><p>This does not destroy the servant permanently. Rather, [[/r 2d6]] days later, its parts—left arm, left leg, right arm, right leg, lower torso, and upper torso—drop from the sky in random places within 1,000 miles of the explosion. If brought within 5 feet of one another, the pieces reconnect and reform the servant.</p></div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--3\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--3\" data-title-index=\"5212\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner help-subtle\">Destroying the Servant.</span></span> <p>The servant can be destroyed in two ways.

Once during your turn while you are holding the pestle, you can extend it into a quarterstaff or shrink it back into a pestle (no action required). As a quarterstaff, the pestle is a magic weapon that grants a +3 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with it.</p><div class=\"rd__spc-inline-post\"></div><p>The pestle has 12 charges. When you hit with a melee attack using the pestle, you can expend up to 3 of its charges to deal an extra [[/r 1d8]] force damage for each charge expended.

For the next minute, or until you use your action to verbally command it to stop, the pestle moves on its own, grinding the contents of the mortar into a mush or fine powder that's equally useful for cooking or alchemy. At the start of each of your turns, whatever is in the mortar takes [[/r 4d10]] force damage. If this reduces the target's hit points to 0, the target is reduced to powder, pulp, or paste, as appropriate. Only magic items are unaffected. If you wish, when the pestle stops, you can have the mortar separate its contents-like powdered bone, crushed herbs, pulped organs-into separate piles.</p><div class=\"rd__spc-inline-post\"></div></div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--3\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--3\" data-title-index=\"5145\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner help-subtle\">Traverse the Night.</span></span> <p>If you are holding the pestle while you are inside the mortar, you can use your action to verbally command the mortar to travel to a specific place or creature.</p><div class=\"rd__spc-inline-post\"></div><p>You don't need to know where your destination is, but it must be a specific destination-not just the nearest river or a red dragon's lair.

Yet, as eons passed, mortals developed their own methods of dealing with existential threats, and the crook was largely forgotten. In recent ages, though, the <i>Crook of Rao</i> was rediscovered and leveraged against the rising power of the Witch Queen Iggwilv (one of the names of the wizard Tasha). Although she was defeated, Iggwilv managed to damage the crook during the battle, infecting it with an insidious curse-and the potential for future victory. In the aftermath, the crook was again lost. Occasionally it reappears, but the famed artifact is not what it was. Whether or not the artifact's bearers realize its full threat, few risk using the <i>Crook of Rao</i> -potentially for the final time.</p><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--3\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--3\" data-title-index=\"5161\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner help-subtle\">Random Properties.</span></span> <p>The artifact has the following random properties, which you can determine by rolling on the tables in the \"Artifacts\" section of the <a href=\"https://5etools-mirror-1.github.io/book.html#DMG\">Dungeon Master's Guide</a>:</p><div class=\"rd__spc-inline-post\"></div><ul class=\"rd__list\"><li class=\"rd__li \">2 @table[Artifact Properties; Minor Beneficial Properties|dmg|minor beneficial] properties</li><li class=\"rd__li \">1 @table[Artifact Properties; Major Beneficial Properties|dmg|major beneficial] property</li><li class=\"rd__li \">1 @table[Artifact Properties; Minor Detrimental Properties|dmg|minor detrimental] property</li></ul></div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--3\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--3\" data-title-index=\"5162\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner help-subtle\">Spells.</span></span> <p>The crook has 6 charges.

If this occurs, the <i>Crook of Rao</i>, as it is currently known, is destroyed, its magical matrix inverting and exploding into a 50-foot-diameter portal. This portal functions as a permanent @spell[gate] spell cast by Iggwilv. The gate then, once per round on initiative count 20, audibly speaks a fiend's name in Iggwilv's voice, doing so until the gate calls on every fiend ever banished by the <i>Crook of Rao</i>. If the fiend still exists, it is drawn through the gate.
