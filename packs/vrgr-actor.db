These specialized but flawed terrors serve a single purpose: to drain the cerebral fluids from sapient minds.

Ghoulish creatures, they let nothing stand between them and their existential imperatives. Although they possess the telepathic abilities of mind flayers, their brains aren't equipped to employ them.

With our minds, we will unearth it, we will plumb its depths, and we will annihilate it.\" With those words, the psychically gifted priest Ulmed founded the Ulmist Inquisition, an order of psionic inquisitors that seeks to discover the wickedness hiding in people's souls.</p><p>In the days before Count Strahd von Zarovich became the first vampire, Strahd thundered across the lands with Ulmed. Their mission was clear: to destroy the infernal powers that had corrupted the world and to ensure that those powers never rose again. Strahd, Ulmed, and their companions hunted Fiends, Undead, Aberrations, and other supernatural threats and were tireless foes of cults like the priests of Osybus. When Strahd fell into darkness, Ulmed was heartbroken at his friend's transformation and changed the inquisition's mission. Instead of focusing on hunting monsters, it would also hunt the seeds of evil that can corrupt a person.</p><p>Ulmed and his friends Cosima, Ansel, and Tristian organized the inquisition into three orders, with each one specializing in a type of psionic power. The Order of Cosima harnessed the Mind Fire—their name for the fire of thought that blazes within each person's mind. They used that power to read thoughts, reshape memories, and dominate the recalcitrant. The inquisitors in the Order of Ansel subjected themselves to harsh asceticism in an effort to use psionic energy to empower their own bodies. They succeeded and became the martial arm of the inquisition, represented by a sword. Finally, the Order of Tristian endeavored to use intellect to alter the environment through telekinetic force, and the order's members became the inquisition's scholars, represented by a tome.</p><p>Today the inquisition rules the city of Malitain, a vast city-state to the north of Barovia's original site, and the inquisition sends its members throughout the multiverse, seeking to thwart the work of malevolent cults, otherworldly horrors, and the malice of mortals. The zeal of the inquisitors in this work has caused them to be a source of terror in many communities, where folk fear that an overzealous inquisitor might be as great a monster as the fiends the inquisitors originally hunted.</p></div>","public":""},"alignment":"","race":"","type":{"value":"humanoid","subtype":"","swarm":null,"custom":""},"environment":"","cr":8,"spellLevel":0,"xp":{"value":3900},"source":"VRGR","class":{}},"traits":{"size":"med","di":{"value":[],"custom":""},"dr":{"value":[],"custom":""},"dv":{"value":[],"custom":""},"ci":{"value":["charmed","frightened"],"custom":""},"languages":{"value":["custom"],"custom":"any two languages; telepathy 120 ft."}},"currency":{"pp":0,"gp":0,"ep":0,"sp":0,"cp":0},"skills":{"acr":{"value":1,"ability":"dex","mod":2,"bonus":0,"passive":12},"ani":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","mod":4,"bonus":0,"passive":14},"arc":{"value":0,"ability":"int","mod":2,"bonus":0,"passive":12},"ath":{"value":1,"ability":"str","mod":1,"bonus":0,"passive":11},"dec":{"value":0,"ability":"cha","mod":3,"bonus":0,"passive":13},"his":{"value":0,"ability":"int","mod":2,"bonus":0,"passive":12},"ins":{"value":1,"ability":"wis","mod":4,"bonus":0,"passive":14},"itm":{"value":0,"ability":"cha","mod":3,"bonus":0,"passive":13},"inv":{"value":0,"ability":"int","mod":2,"bonus":0,"passive":12},"med":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","mod":4,"bonus":0,"passive":14},"nat":{"value":0,"ability":"int","mod":2,"bonus":0,"passive":12},"prc":{"value":1,"ability":"wis","mod":4,"bonus":0,"passive":14},"prf":{"value":0,"ability":"cha","mod":3,"bonus":0,"passive":13},"per":{"value":0,"ability":"cha","mod":3,"bonus":0,"passive":13},"rel":{"value":0,"ability":"int","mod":2,"bonus":0,"passive":12},"slt":{"value":0,"ability":"dex","mod":2,"bonus":0,"passive":12},"ste":{"value":0,"ability":"dex","mod":2,"bonus":0,"passive":12},"sur":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","mod":4,"bonus":0,"passive":14}},"spells":{"spell1":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell2":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell3":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell4":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell5":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell6":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell7":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell8":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell9":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"pact":{"value":0,"override":null},"spell0":{"value":0,"max":0}},"bonuses":{"mwak":{"attack":"","damage":""},"rwak":{"attack":"","damage":""},"msak":{"attack":"","damage":""},"rsak":{"attack":"","damage":""},"abilities":{"check":"","save":"","skill":""},"spell":{"dc":""}},"resources":{"legact":{"value":0,"max":0},"legres":{"value":0,"max":0},"lair":{"value":false,"initiative":20}}},"token":{"displayName":20,"vision":true,"disposition":-1,"displayBars":40,"bar1":{"attribute":"attributes.hp"},"bar2":{"attribute":null},"dimSight":0,"brightSight":30,"name":"Inquisitor of the Sword","img":"https://assets.forge-vtt.com/60f6df8c8ea0d66d4f271bc4/assets/srd5e/img/VRGR/Inquisitor%20of%20the%20Sword.png","width":1,"height":1,"scale":1,"elevation":0,"rotation":0,"actorLink":false,"actorData":{},"flags":{},"effects":[],"randomImg":false,"mirrorX":false,"mirrorY":false,"lockRotation":false,"alpha":1,"dimLight":0,"brightLight":0,"sightAngle":0,"lightAngle":0,"lightAlpha":0.25,"lightAnimation":{"speed":5,"intensity":5}},"items":[{"name":"Dimension Door","type":"spell","data":{"description":{"value":"<div  class=\"rd__b  rd__b--3\"><p>You teleport yourself from your current location to any other spot within range.

Using this soul power, each priest can defy death and become an undead creature, potentially cheating the grave over and over.</p><p>This unholy order of priests was founded centuries ago by Osybus, a mysterious figure of unfathomable ambition and evil. Osybus sought to use others' souls as springboards to his own immortality. He forged pacts with any entity that would give him more power and delved into any eldritch secret that would prolong his life. He became a devotee of the Dark Powers and tapped into their immortal malice to fuel his apotheosis.</p><p>As his power grew, he attracted disciples who also wished to defy life and death. He shared his dread secrets with them and demanded their worship. In time, his goal was achieved: he became a lich of almost godly power. Acknowledging the role that his disciples played in his ascension, Osybus gifted them with a trace of his power. Taking the form of a shadowy tattoo, this boon allows the priests to steal souls as their master did and to cheat death and become undead horrors.</p><p>The threat posed by Osybus and his disciples raised alarms far and wide. In response, the Ulmist Inquisition and the then-mortal Count Strahd von Zarovich faced the lich in battle. Their bravery would have been for naught if Osybus's disciples hadn't betrayed him. Fearing that their master would eventually consume their souls, the disciples aided Osybus's foes and destroyed his physical form. As he perished, he uttered a curse upon them—that their immortality would fail them when they least expected it and that he himself would become one of the Dark Powers. As a result of that curse, a priest of Osybus can't be certain that they will be reborn when they perish.</p><p>In an effort to rid themselves of this curse, they devoted themselves to the same Dark Powers with whom their master had communed. They were given a mission: provide a person of nobility and might to serve as an earthly vessel for these powers to enter the world and conquer it. If they succeeded, their immortality would be assured. A suitable vessel they did then find: Strahd von Zarovich. Working in shadows and through intermediaries, the priests whispered hatred to the count, and when his noble heart was corrupted, they were the ones who laid the path before him that led to the Amber Temple and his fall into vampirism.</p><p>But they were then betrayed. Osybus had not lied; he had himself become one of the Dark Powers, and he and the other Dark Powers had conjured up a misty prison to contain the newly immortal Strahd, thereby preventing the count from serving as the conquering force that the priests sought to loose upon the world; thus they were denied their reward of immortality.</p><p>To this day, the priests of Osybus seek to unleash Strahd from the mists, often using adventurers as their pawns. They also ironically bear their hated founder's name, for they know it is his original deathly gift that gives them their horrific powers.</p></div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--0\"><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--1\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--1\" data-title-index=\"4178\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Boons of Undeath</span></span> <p>When a priest of Osybus drops to 0 hit points, the priest might revive with a benefit from the Boons of Undeath table.

In the course of their relentless marches, zombies might suffer all manner of trauma, potentially reducing them to masses of crawling limbs (see swarm of zombie limbs), infecting them with terrible diseases, or crushing an entire horde into a single, rotting titan (see zombie clot).</p><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--2\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--2\" data-title-index=\"4203\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Zombie Apocalypses</span></span> <p>Among the types of horror adventures detailed in <a href=\"https://5etools-mirror-1.github.io/book.html#VRGR,2\">chapter 2</a>, tales of uncontrolled zombie outbreaks orbit the <a href=\"https://5etools-mirror-1.github.io/book.html#VRGR,2,dark%20fantasy,0\">dark fantasy</a> and <a href=\"https://5etools-mirror-1.github.io/book.html#VRGR,2,disaster%20horror,0\">disaster horror</a> genres.

In this role, she defended the Feywild against dragons, demons, and other threats. In time, her heroics caught the eye of an archfey named Zybilna, who had forged secret pacts with some of the fiends Isolde and her companions had slain. Rather than be angry at Isolde, Zybilna was impressed by her. She enlisted a powerful fiend known only as \"the Caller\" to corrupt and slay all of Isolde's companions, leaving Isolde alone, bitter, and vulnerable. The insidious archfey then befriended Isolde and offered to help her forget her terrible losses. Isolde became the master of a traveling fey carnival that served as a gateway to Zybilna's domain. The carnival did what Zybilna hoped it would do: it brought comfort to Isolde and quelled her thirst for vengeance.</p><p>Zybilna and Isolde enjoyed a strong partnership for years, but as time wore on, they grew distant until their relationship finally soured. Eladrin crave change, yet Isolde felt like she was frozen in time. She wished to leave the fey carnival and pursue other dreams, but Zybilna wouldn't hear of it and secretly used @spell[wish] spells to make Isolde place her devotion to the carnival above her desire to leave it.</p><p>When Isolde's fey carnival crossed paths with another carnival from the Shadowfell, the eladrin found the escape she longed for. Isolde orchestrated a trade with the other carnival's owners, a pair of shadar-kai (elves native to the Shadowfell). Isolde would become the master of their carnival, and they would become the masters of hers. To appease Zybilna, this arrangement would remain in place only until the two carnivals crossed paths again.</p><p>Zybilna was intrigued enough by the shadar-kai to let Isolde go, but not without casting a spell that made Isolde forget about Zybilna and her Feywild domain, thus preventing the eladrin from divulging the archfey's secrets. As a further punishment, Zybilna sent malevolent fey creatures to hound Isolde and her Shadowfell carnival. Isolde doesn't know who is behind this petty torment, nor does she care. Her hunt for the Caller and her thirst for vengeance have become all-consuming.</p></div>","public":""},"alignment":"any evil alignment","race":"","type":{"value":"fey","subtype":"elf","swarm":null,"custom":""},"environment":"","cr":5,"spellLevel":0,"xp":{"value":1800},"source":"VRGR","class":{}},"traits":{"size":"med","di":{"value":[],"custom":""},"dr":{"value":["cold","fire","lightning","poison","physical"],"custom":""},"dv":{"value":[],"custom":""},"ci":{"value":[],"custom":""},"languages":{"value":["abyssal","common","infernal"],"custom":""}},"currency":{"pp":0,"gp":0,"ep":0,"sp":0,"cp":0},"skills":{"acr":{"value":0,"ability":"dex","mod":4,"bonus":0,"passive":14},"ani":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","mod":1,"bonus":0,"passive":11},"arc":{"value":0,"ability":"int","mod":2,"bonus":0,"passive":12},"ath":{"value":0,"ability":"str","mod":4,"bonus":0,"passive":14},"dec":{"value":1,"ability":"cha","mod":3,"bonus":0,"passive":13},"his":{"value":0,"ability":"int","mod":2,"bonus":0,"passive":12},"ins":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","mod":1,"bonus":0,"passive":11},"itm":{"value":1,"ability":"cha","mod":3,"bonus":0,"passive":13},"inv":{"value":0,"ability":"int","mod":2,"bonus":0,"passive":12},"med":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","mod":1,"bonus":0,"passive":11},"nat":{"value":0,"ability":"int","mod":2,"bonus":0,"passive":12},"prc":{"value":1,"ability":"wis","mod":1,"bonus":0,"passive":11},"prf":{"value":0,"ability":"cha","mod":3,"bonus":0,"passive":13},"per":{"value":0,"ability":"cha","mod":3,"bonus":0,"passive":13},"rel":{"value":0,"ability":"int","mod":2,"bonus":0,"passive":12},"slt":{"value":0,"ability":"dex","mod":4,"bonus":0,"passive":14},"ste":{"value":1,"ability":"dex","mod":4,"bonus":0,"passive":14},"sur":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","mod":1,"bonus":0,"passive":11}},"spells":{"spell1":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell2":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell3":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell4":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell5":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell6":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell7":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell8":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell9":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"pact":{"value":0,"override":null},"spell0":{"value":0,"max":0}},"bonuses":{"mwak":{"attack":"","damage":""},"rwak":{"attack":"","damage":""},"msak":{"attack":"","damage":""},"rsak":{"attack":"","damage":""},"abilities":{"check":"","save":"","skill":""},"spell":{"dc":""}},"resources":{"legact":{"value":0,"max":0},"legres":{"value":0,"max":0},"lair":{"value":false,"initiative":20}}},"token":{"displayName":20,"vision":true,"disposition":-1,"displayBars":40,"bar1":{"attribute":"attributes.hp"},"bar2":{"attribute":null},"dimSight":60,"brightSight":0,"name":"Isolde","img":"https://assets.forge-vtt.com/60f6df8c8ea0d66d4f271bc4/assets/srd5e/img/VRGR/Isolde.png","width":1,"height":1,"scale":1,"elevation":0,"rotation":0,"actorLink":false,"actorData":{},"flags":{},"effects":[],"randomImg":false,"mirrorX":false,"mirrorY":false,"lockRotation":false,"alpha":1,"dimLight":0,"brightLight":0,"sightAngle":0,"lightAngle":0,"lightAlpha":0.25,"lightAnimation":{"speed":5,"intensity":5}},"items":[{"name":"Plane Shift","type":"spell","data":{"description":{"value":"<div  class=\"rd__b  rd__b--3\"><p>You and up to eight willing creatures who link hands in a circle are transported to a different plane of existence.

Heralded by ominous astrological events, these ravenous invaders make worlds ready for unimaginable masters or distant, greater manifestations of themselves. Employing their malleable forms, emissaries work to undermine perceptions of order, trust, and reality on global scales, readying worlds for sanity-shattering revelations and cascading apocalypses. Only when truly threatened, or when their foes have lost all hope, do emissaries reveal their actual, impossible forms.</p><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--2\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--2\" data-title-index=\"4176\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Forms of the Emissary</span></span> <p>Star spawn emissaries can assume two forms: a lesser form suited to infiltration and a greater, physically overwhelming form. To destroy an emissary, characters must reduce each of its forms to 0 hit points one after another. Typically, a star spawn emissary is initially encountered in its lesser form. When this form is destroyed, the emissary's body collapses into a gory slurry. It then instantly returns in its greater form. Only if the emissary is defeated in its greater form does the star spawn die.</p><p>After finishing a long rest, a greater star spawn emissary regains its lesser form if it was destroyed. When an emissary transitions from one form to another, it loses all the traits and actions of the previous form and gains those of the new form.</p></div></div></div>","public":""},"alignment":"","race":"","type":{"value":"aberration","subtype":"","swarm":null,"custom":""},"environment":"","cr":19,"spellLevel":0,"xp":{"value":22000},"source":"VRGR","class":{}},"traits":{"size":"med","di":{"value":[],"custom":""},"dr":{"value":["acid","force","necrotic","psychic"],"custom":""},"dv":{"value":[],"custom":""},"ci":{"value":["charmed","frightened"],"custom":""},"languages":{"value":["common","aarakocra","abyssal","aquan","auran","celestial","deep","draconic","druidic","dwarvish","elvish","giant","gith","gnomish","goblin","gnoll","halfling","ignan","infernal","orc","primordial","sylvan","terran","cant","undercommon","custom"],"custom":"telepathy

With our minds, we will unearth it, we will plumb its depths, and we will annihilate it.\" With those words, the psychically gifted priest Ulmed founded the Ulmist Inquisition, an order of psionic inquisitors that seeks to discover the wickedness hiding in people's souls.</p><p>In the days before Count Strahd von Zarovich became the first vampire, Strahd thundered across the lands with Ulmed. Their mission was clear: to destroy the infernal powers that had corrupted the world and to ensure that those powers never rose again. Strahd, Ulmed, and their companions hunted Fiends, Undead, Aberrations, and other supernatural threats and were tireless foes of cults like the priests of Osybus. When Strahd fell into darkness, Ulmed was heartbroken at his friend's transformation and changed the inquisition's mission. Instead of focusing on hunting monsters, it would also hunt the seeds of evil that can corrupt a person.</p><p>Ulmed and his friends Cosima, Ansel, and Tristian organized the inquisition into three orders, with each one specializing in a type of psionic power. The Order of Cosima harnessed the Mind Fire—their name for the fire of thought that blazes within each person's mind. They used that power to read thoughts, reshape memories, and dominate the recalcitrant. The inquisitors in the Order of Ansel subjected themselves to harsh asceticism in an effort to use psionic energy to empower their own bodies. They succeeded and became the martial arm of the inquisition, represented by a sword. Finally, the Order of Tristian endeavored to use intellect to alter the environment through telekinetic force, and the order's members became the inquisition's scholars, represented by a tome.</p><p>Today the inquisition rules the city of Malitain, a vast city-state to the north of Barovia's original site, and the inquisition sends its members throughout the multiverse, seeking to thwart the work of malevolent cults, otherworldly horrors, and the malice of mortals. The zeal of the inquisitors in this work has caused them to be a source of terror in many communities, where folk fear that an overzealous inquisitor might be as great a monster as the fiends the inquisitors originally hunted.</p></div>","public":""},"alignment":"","race":"","type":{"value":"humanoid","subtype":"","swarm":null,"custom":""},"environment":"","cr":8,"spellLevel":0,"xp":{"value":3900},"source":"VRGR","class":{}},"traits":{"size":"med","di":{"value":[],"custom":""},"dr":{"value":[],"custom":""},"dv":{"value":[],"custom":""},"ci":{"value":["charmed","frightened"],"custom":""},"languages":{"value":["custom"],"custom":"any four languages; telepathy 120 ft."}},"currency":{"pp":0,"gp":0,"ep":0,"sp":0,"cp":0},"skills":{"acr":{"value":0,"ability":"dex","mod":1,"bonus":0,"passive":11},"ani":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","mod":3,"bonus":0,"passive":13},"arc":{"value":2,"ability":"int","mod":4,"bonus":0,"passive":14},"ath":{"value":0,"ability":"str","mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10},"dec":{"value":0,"ability":"cha","mod":2,"bonus":0,"passive":12},"his":{"value":1,"ability":"int","mod":4,"bonus":0,"passive":14},"ins":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","mod":3,"bonus":0,"passive":13},"itm":{"value":0,"ability":"cha","mod":2,"bonus":0,"passive":12},"inv":{"value":0,"ability":"int","mod":4,"bonus":0,"passive":14},"med":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","mod":3,"bonus":0,"passive":13},"nat":{"value":1,"ability":"int","mod":4,"bonus":0,"passive":14},"prc":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","mod":3,"bonus":0,"passive":13},"prf":{"value":0,"ability":"cha","mod":2,"bonus":0,"passive":12},"per":{"value":0,"ability":"cha","mod":2,"bonus":0,"passive":12},"rel":{"value":2,"ability":"int","mod":4,"bonus":0,"passive":14},"slt":{"value":0,"ability":"dex","mod":1,"bonus":0,"passive":11},"ste":{"value":0,"ability":"dex","mod":1,"bonus":0,"passive":11},"sur":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","mod":3,"bonus":0,"passive":13}},"spells":{"spell1":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell2":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell3":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell4":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell5":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell6":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell7":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell8":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell9":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"pact":{"value":0,"override":null},"spell0":{"value":0,"max":0}},"bonuses":{"mwak":{"attack":"","damage":""},"rwak":{"attack":"","damage":""},"msak":{"attack":"","damage":""},"rsak":{"attack":"","damage":""},"abilities":{"check":"","save":"","skill":""},"spell":{"dc":""}},"resources":{"legact":{"value":0,"max":0},"legres":{"value":0,"max":0},"lair":{"value":false,"initiative":20}}},"token":{"displayName":20,"vision":true,"disposition":-1,"displayBars":40,"bar1":{"attribute":"attributes.hp"},"bar2":{"attribute":null},"dimSight":0,"brightSight":30,"name":"Inquisitor of the Tome","img":"https://assets.forge-vtt.com/60f6df8c8ea0d66d4f271bc4/assets/srd5e/img/VRGR/Inquisitor%20of%20the%20Tome.png","width":1,"height":1,"scale":1,"elevation":0,"rotation":0,"actorLink":false,"actorData":{},"flags":{},"effects":[],"randomImg":false,"mirrorX":false,"mirrorY":false,"lockRotation":false,"alpha":1,"dimLight":0,"brightLight":0,"sightAngle":0,"lightAngle":0,"lightAlpha":0.25,"lightAnimation":{"speed":5,"intensity":5}},"items":[{"name":"Otiluke's Resilient Sphere","type":"spell","data":{"description":{"value":"<div  class=\"rd__b  rd__b--3\"><p>A sphere of shimmering force encloses a creature or object of Large size or smaller within range.

With our minds, we will unearth it, we will plumb its depths, and we will annihilate it.\" With those words, the psychically gifted priest Ulmed founded the Ulmist Inquisition, an order of psionic inquisitors that seeks to discover the wickedness hiding in people's souls.</p><p>In the days before Count Strahd von Zarovich became the first vampire, Strahd thundered across the lands with Ulmed. Their mission was clear: to destroy the infernal powers that had corrupted the world and to ensure that those powers never rose again. Strahd, Ulmed, and their companions hunted Fiends, Undead, Aberrations, and other supernatural threats and were tireless foes of cults like the priests of Osybus. When Strahd fell into darkness, Ulmed was heartbroken at his friend's transformation and changed the inquisition's mission. Instead of focusing on hunting monsters, it would also hunt the seeds of evil that can corrupt a person.</p><p>Ulmed and his friends Cosima, Ansel, and Tristian organized the inquisition into three orders, with each one specializing in a type of psionic power. The Order of Cosima harnessed the Mind Fire—their name for the fire of thought that blazes within each person's mind. They used that power to read thoughts, reshape memories, and dominate the recalcitrant. The inquisitors in the Order of Ansel subjected themselves to harsh asceticism in an effort to use psionic energy to empower their own bodies. They succeeded and became the martial arm of the inquisition, represented by a sword. Finally, the Order of Tristian endeavored to use intellect to alter the environment through telekinetic force, and the order's members became the inquisition's scholars, represented by a tome.</p><p>Today the inquisition rules the city of Malitain, a vast city-state to the north of Barovia's original site, and the inquisition sends its members throughout the multiverse, seeking to thwart the work of malevolent cults, otherworldly horrors, and the malice of mortals. The zeal of the inquisitors in this work has caused them to be a source of terror in many communities, where folk fear that an overzealous inquisitor might be as great a monster as the fiends the inquisitors originally hunted.</p></div>","public":""},"alignment":"","race":"","type":{"value":"humanoid","subtype":"","swarm":null,"custom":""},"environment":"","cr":8,"spellLevel":0,"xp":{"value":3900},"source":"VRGR","class":{}},"traits":{"size":"med","di":{"value":[],"custom":""},"dr":{"value":[],"custom":""},"dv":{"value":[],"custom":""},"ci":{"value":["charmed","frightened"],"custom":""},"languages":{"value":["custom"],"custom":"any three languages; telepathy 120 ft."}},"currency":{"pp":0,"gp":0,"ep":0,"sp":0,"cp":0},"skills":{"acr":{"value":0,"ability":"dex","mod":2,"bonus":0,"passive":12},"ani":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","mod":3,"bonus":0,"passive":13},"arc":{"value":0,"ability":"int","mod":3,"bonus":0,"passive":13},"ath":{"value":0,"ability":"str","mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10},"dec":{"value":0,"ability":"cha","mod":4,"bonus":0,"passive":14},"his":{"value":0,"ability":"int","mod":3,"bonus":0,"passive":13},"ins":{"value":1,"ability":"wis","mod":3,"bonus":0,"passive":13},"itm":{"value":0,"ability":"cha","mod":4,"bonus":0,"passive":14},"inv":{"value":0,"ability":"int","mod":3,"bonus":0,"passive":13},"med":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","mod":3,"bonus":0,"passive":13},"nat":{"value":0,"ability":"int","mod":3,"bonus":0,"passive":13},"prc":{"value":1,"ability":"wis","mod":3,"bonus":0,"passive":13},"prf":{"value":0,"ability":"cha","mod":4,"bonus":0,"passive":14},"per":{"value":0,"ability":"cha","mod":4,"bonus":0,"passive":14},"rel":{"value":0,"ability":"int","mod":3,"bonus":0,"passive":13},"slt":{"value":0,"ability":"dex","mod":2,"bonus":0,"passive":12},"ste":{"value":0,"ability":"dex","mod":2,"bonus":0,"passive":12},"sur":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","mod":3,"bonus":0,"passive":13}},"spells":{"spell1":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell2":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell3":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell4":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell5":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell6":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell7":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell8":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell9":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"pact":{"value":0,"override":null},"spell0":{"value":0,"max":0}},"bonuses":{"mwak":{"attack":"","damage":""},"rwak":{"attack":"","damage":""},"msak":{"attack":"","damage":""},"rsak":{"attack":"","damage":""},"abilities":{"check":"","save":"","skill":""},"spell":{"dc":""}},"resources":{"legact":{"value":0,"max":0},"legres":{"value":0,"max":0},"lair":{"value":false,"initiative":20}}},"token":{"displayName":20,"vision":true,"disposition":-1,"displayBars":40,"bar1":{"attribute":"attributes.hp"},"bar2":{"attribute":null},"dimSight":0,"brightSight":30,"name":"Inquisitor of the Mind Fire","img":"https://assets.forge-vtt.com/60f6df8c8ea0d66d4f271bc4/assets/srd5e/img/VRGR/Inquisitor%20of%20the%20Mind%20Fire.png","width":1,"height":1,"scale":1,"elevation":0,"rotation":0,"actorLink":false,"actorData":{},"flags":{},"effects":[],"randomImg":false,"mirrorX":false,"mirrorY":false,"lockRotation":false,"alpha":1,"dimLight":0,"brightLight":0,"sightAngle":0,"lightAngle":0,"lightAlpha":0.25,"lightAnimation":{"speed":5,"intensity":5}},"items":[{"name":"Mass Suggestion","type":"spell","data":{"description":{"value":"<div  class=\"rd__b  rd__b--3\"><p>You suggest a course of activity (limited to a sentence or two) and magically influence up to twelve creatures of your choice that you can see within range and that can hear and understand you.
